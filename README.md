# excel-project
In this Excel project, I created an interactive dashboard from a bike buyers dataset. Key tasks included data cleaning (removing duplicates and standardizing entries), using pivot tables for data summarization, and building visualizations like charts. The dashboard featured interactive slicers and filters for dynamic exploration.
